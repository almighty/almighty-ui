= ALMighty UI


If this is the first time you are starting the UI you need to run

----
$ npm install
----

Start the app in dev mode, expected to only run adhoc on the developer workstation, by executing the following. 

----
$ npm start
----

In order to deploy the app on a service, you need to :

----
$ npm run build:prod
----

and ship the content from ./dist/ behind a webserver



If you wish to run the app with the in-memory dataset, you need to uncomment the lines as follows:

- The URL and the `GetWorkItems()` in  `src/app/work-item/work-item.service.ts`.
- The `providers` section in `src/app/app.module.ts`
