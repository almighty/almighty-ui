= ALMighty UI

=== ALMighty UI is a currently an application planner and issue tracker front-end.
It uses https://github.com/almighty/almighty-core[ALMighty-core] as the back-end.

If this is the first time you are starting the UI you need to run

----
$ npm install
----

If you trying to refresh your install you can run:

----
$ npm run reinstall
----

Start the app by executing the following. 

----
$ npm start
----

If you wish to run the app with the in-memory dataset, you need to set an environment
variable "ENV" to "inmemory" and do a rebuild. The setting is stored inside the build, 
changing the value back to unset or "development" (default for npm start) needs a rebuild
to take effect.

== Run All Checks

To run the linter, build validator, unit tests, and functional test use:

----
$ npm test
----


== Lint

To run the TypeScript and Angular 2 linter, use:

----
$ npm run lint
----

NOTE: They also run during the unit tests.

== Build Validation

To validate the webpack build, use:

----
$ npm run validate
----

NOTE: Validation also runs the unit tests.

== Unit Tests

To run the unit test, use:

----
$ npm run test:unit
----

To run the unit test in a watch mode so that they are rerun every time you save, use:

----
$ npm run watch:test
----

Unit (UI) tests are automatically executed on the PR(pull request) check process (using
`cico_run_tests.sh`) or on the release process (using `cico_build_deploy.sh`). To executed
these scripts from the development environment you can run the following script:

----
./run_unit_tests.sh
----

For unit testing, Jasmine, Karma, Webpack is used. There are unit tests available for 
both services and UI components. There are `.spec.ts` files available in individual
component or service folder. Karma and Webpack config is written inside config directory
under root.

== Functional Tests

To run the functional test, use:

----
$ npm run test:func
----

Functional (UI) tests are automatically executed on the PR check process (using
`cico_run_tests.sh`) or on the release process (using `cico_build_deploy.sh`) but
can also be executed from the development environment by invoking the following command:

----
./run_functional_tests.sh
----

External resources are mocked. A Java JRE, ncat and fuser have to be available on the
system (see Dockerfile.builder for details on the required packages when building on
Fedora/CentOS). PhantomJS will be used as the browser engine by default. This can be
changed by adding/modifying browser capabilities in `protractor.config.js`.

Test specs for functional tests are residing in `src/tests`.

== Production Build

To generate production build, set the API URL and run `npm` command as give below:

----
export API_URL="http://api.example.org/api/"
npm run build:prod
----

The build output will be under `dist` directory.

To create docker image, run this command immediately after the previous command:

----
docker build -t almighty-ui-deploy -f Dockerfile.deploy .
----
