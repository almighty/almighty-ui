= Test Runner

This project contains a simple test runner for Protractor Angular tests. The intention is to have an 
isolated test runner that does not share dependencies with code under test. This test runner works
standalone and just needs to be pointed at a set of Typescript test specs and an URL to test them on.

Please note that this test runner is for **black box tests** only!

== Preparing the Test Runner

You need to get dependencies before running the test runner:

```
npm install
```

You will also need to have `curl` and `bash` installed on your system and available in the path.

== Providing Test Specs

To run a test suite, you need to create a set of test specs (which may include page objects). The
test specs source directory needs to include a `tsconfig.json` configuration file. The path to the 
spec source directory has to be provided using the env variable `TEST_SOURCE_PATH`:

== Running Tests

Next, you need to provide a URL of the system under test using the env variable `BASE_URL`. If 
`BASE_URL` is not set, `http://localhost:8088/` is used.

Tests can then be run with:

```
npm test
```

This will compile the specs, add dependencies and runs the test specs.

== Additional Configuration

The test runner supports the following env variables to configure behaviour:

|=======
|`BASE_URL` | URL of the system under test. Defaults to `http://localhost:8088/`.
|`TEST_SOURCE_PATH` | Path to the spec source directory. Defaults to the included examples in `example-test-src`.
|`TEMP_DIR` | Temporary directory for the test run. Defaults to a generated temporary directory.
|`SPECS_PATTERN` | File pattern for the Protractor run. This should never be modified/set.
|=======

The test runner uses a fixed set of dependencies defined in `package.json` of the test runner. The specs will
run with the same dependencies. If you need additional dependencies, you may have to modify the test runner's 
`package.json`.
